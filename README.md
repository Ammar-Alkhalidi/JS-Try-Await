- Task 1: Style a Paragraph on Button Click
Objective:
Change the style of a paragraph dynamically when a button is clicked.

# Functionality:
When the button is clicked, the paragraph:
Changes color to red.
Uses the monospace font-family.
Has a font size of 4em.
Solution:
The addEventListener method is used to attach a click event to the button. The paragraph's styles are updated using JavaScriptâ€™s style property.

- Task 2: Highlight a Navigation Link
Objective:
Select and highlight the first link in a navigation bar.

# Functionality:
Print the text of the first link (Home) to the console.
Add the active class to the link to visually highlight it.
Solution:
The querySelector method is used to select the first navigation link. The classList.add method is used to apply the active class.

- Task 3: Dynamically Create a Styled Div
Objective:
Create a div element dynamically and add it to the body.

# Functionality:
The created div has:
A box class.
Predefined styles such as a teal background and fixed dimensions.
Solution:
The createElement method is used to create the div. The classList.add method assigns the box class, and appendChild appends it to the body.

- Task 4: Cross Out Tasks on Click
Objective:
Toggle the line-through style on a task when it is clicked.

# Functionality:
Clicking a task crosses it out or removes the cross-out effect.
This is achieved by toggling the text-decoration style or a CSS class.
Solution:
Each task is assigned a click event listener using forEach on a list of task elements. The classList.toggle method is used to apply a crossed-out class, which contains the required styles.

- Task 5: Form Validation with Success and Error Messages
Objective:
Validate a form upon submission and display appropriate feedback.

# Functionality:
Check if the email and password fields are filled.
Display a success message with a green background if both fields are filled.
Display an error message with a red background if either field is empty.
Ensure the message div never contains both success and error classes.
Solution:
The addEventListener method is used to attach a submit event to the form. Validation logic is encapsulated in a function, which updates the message and styles dynamically. In the alternate version, validation is handled using Promises to simulate asynchronous processes.

# Technologies Used
* HTML: Structure of the tasks and elements.
* CSS: Styling of elements (e.g., hover effects, classes like error and success).
* JavaScript: Logic for interactivity, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
